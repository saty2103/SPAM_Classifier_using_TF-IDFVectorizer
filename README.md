# SPAM_Classifier_using_TF-IDFVectorizer

Detecting SPAM texts is necessary for security purposes. To train the machine to detect SPAM texts is difficult as machine is unable to understand any textual data.
Hence, we use TF-IDF Vectorizer model to transform the text messages into float type vectors.
Subsequently then we can use the given SPAM dataset to train the machine model.

In this project, we have used LogisticClassifier and Random Forest Classifier. Also, we have used UNDER-SAMPLING technique to BALANCE the training dataset.
